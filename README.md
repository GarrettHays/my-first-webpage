# My First Webpage

#### By Garrett Hays

#### A basic webpage that I created for the first time.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS

## Description

_{This is a webpage I created during my first few days attending Epicodus. It serves as a starting point for my coding career and will be an interesting item to look back on to see how far we have all come.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* None

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

* None
